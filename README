mash is a tool that creates repositories from koji tags, and solves
them for multilib dependencies.

Mash takes a .mash settings file and generates a yum repository.

For example:
$ mash --output /mnt/repo/ f15

This tells mash to generate the repository to /mnt/repo, and to use
the configuration file "f15.mash".

Mash's main configuration is at /etc/mash. The main mash.conf file
contains basic settings for using mash. The other configurations end
in ".mash".
